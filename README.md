- JavaScript is a high-level programming language.
- It was originally designed as a scripting language for websites but became widely adopted as a general-purpose programming language.
- JavaScript is currently the most popular programming language in use.
- It is commonly found running in web browsers as interactive or automated content.
- JavaScript is used for a wide range of purposes, from simple popup messages and live clocks to large web applications.
- It is also commonly used in server-side programming through platforms like Node.js.
- JavaScript can be "embedded" in non-JavaScript applications where the base programming language lacks high-level functionality.
- Despite the similarities in name and syntax, JavaScript is not related to the programming language Java.
- JavaScript programs are made up of a collection of instructions called "statements".
- Variables in JavaScript can be defined using the `var` keyword in older versions (ES5) or `const` for constant variables and `let` for local variables in newer versions.
- Constant variables cannot be re-declared or reassigned.
